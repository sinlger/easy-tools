# XML Formatting Tool Usage Guide

## I. Tool Introduction

The XML formatting tool is a simple and practical online tool that can format XML strings into a readable format. It facilitates developers to quickly view and edit XML data, thereby improving work efficiency.

## II. Feature Introduction

### (I) XML Formatting Feature

1. **Input XML Strings**: In the "Your XML" section, you can directly paste or input the XML strings that need to be formatted. For example, an XML text like this:
   - `<hello><world>foo</world><world>bar</world></hello>`

2. **Automatic Formatting Display**: The tool will automatically format the XML strings you input into a clearer structure and display the result in the "Formatted XML from your XML" section. The formatted output will look like this:
   - `<hello>`
   - `<world>foo</world>`
   - `<world>bar</world>`
   - `</hello>`

### (II) Formatting Settings Feature

1. **Collapse Content Setting**: Using the switch button after "Collapse content", you can choose to fold the XML content. When the folding function is enabled, the formatted XML document will fold some content, making it easier to browse the overall structure quickly. When disabled, all content details will be displayed fully.
2. **Indent Size Setting**: In the input box after "Indent size", you can specify the indent size for formatting. The default is 2 spaces. You can adjust it according to personal habits or project requirements, and the tool will reformat the XML document according to the indent size you set.
