# IT Tools - Base64 String Encoder/Decoder User Guide

## Tool Overview

The IT Tools Base64 string encoder/decoder is a handy online utility that allows for quick conversion between strings and their Base64 representations. It is designed to meet the needs of developers when dealing with data encoding and network transmission, offering a simple and efficient way to encode or decode strings.

## Functionality

### String to Base64 Encoding

  * **Input String for Encoding**: Enter the string you wish to convert into Base64 format. It can be any combination of characters, such as text, numbers, and special symbols.
  * **URL-Safe Encoding Option**: The “Encode URL safe” toggle switch is available. When enabled, the encoding process will use the URL-safe Base64 encoding method, replacing “+” with “-” and “/” with “_”, and omitting the “=” sign at the end. This makes the encoded string more suitable for use in URLs.
  * **Base64 Encoding Result Display**: After the encoding operation is completed, the Base64 representation of the input string will be shown here.
  * **Copy Base64 Encoding Result**: The “Copy base64” button allows you to copy the Base64 encoding result to the clipboard. This makes it convenient to use the encoded string elsewhere, such as in code editors, text editors, or messaging apps.

### Base64 to String Decoding

  * **Input Base64 String for Decoding**: Paste the Base64 string that you want to decode into this area. Ensure that the input string is properly formatted in Base64, otherwise decoding may fail or produce incorrect results.
  * **URL-Safe Decoding Option**: Corresponding to the encoding function, the “Decode URL safe” toggle switch is provided. If the Base64 string was encoded using the URL-safe method, enable this option to ensure correct decoding and accurate restoration of the original string.
  * **Decoded String Result Display**: After decoding, the original string will be displayed here, allowing you to view the readable string content converted from the Base64 format.
  * **Copy Decoded String**: The “Copy decoded string” button enables you to copy the decoded string to the clipboard. This facilitates the use of the original string in other scenarios, such as inserting it into documents or using it as input parameters for programs.
