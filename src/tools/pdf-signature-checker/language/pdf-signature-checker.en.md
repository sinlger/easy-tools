# PDF Signature Checker User Manual

## I. Tool Introduction

The PDF Signature Checker is an online tool designed to verify the validity of signatures in a PDF file. By using this tool, you can check whether the content of a PDF file has been altered after it was signed, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the file.

## II. Main Functions

  1. **Signature Validation**
     * Upload a PDF file with signatures, and the tool will automatically detect and validate the signatures within the file. If the signature is valid, it indicates that the file content has not been tampered with after signing; if the signature is invalid, it may suggest that the file content has been modified.
     * It supports validating multiple signatures. For PDF files with several signatures, it can check the validity of each signature one by one, ensuring that all signature parts of the file are unaffected.

  2. **File Upload and Operation**
     * It offers a drag - and - drop upload feature. Users can directly drag and drop the PDF file into the designated area for convenient and quick file upload.
     * Alternatively, users can click the “Browse files” button to select the PDF file to be verified from the local file system.

## III. Steps to Use

  1. Open the webpage: Enter <https://it> - tools.tech/pdf-signature-checker in the browser to access the PDF Signature Checker page.
  2. Upload the file: Upload the PDF file to be verified by dragging and dropping it or by clicking the “Browse files” button.
  3. Wait for validation: After uploading, the tool will automatically validate the signatures in the file. Wait for a moment to see the validation results.
  4. View results: Based on the information returned by the tool, understand the validity of the signatures and whether the file content has been changed after signing.

## IV. Precautions

  1. File format: Ensure that the uploaded file is in the standard PDF format; otherwise, it may not be able to undergo signature validation properly.
  2. File size: Although the tool has certain limitations on file size, uploading extremely large files may result in slow upload speeds or issues during the validation process. It is recommended to upload PDF files of moderate size.
  3. Signature validity: The signature validation results are for reference only. For some special cases, it may be necessary to use other professional tools or methods for further confirmation.
