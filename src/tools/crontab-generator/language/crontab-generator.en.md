## 2. Features

  1. **Crontab Expression Generation**

     * **Manual Input** : You can directly enter a Crontab expression into the input box, such as “40 * * * *”. The tool will automatically generate the corresponding description, “At 40 minutes past the hour, every hour, every day”.
     * **Predefined Expressions** : The tool offers various predefined expression options, like “@yearly”, “@monthly”, etc. Clicking on an option will quickly generate the corresponding Crontab expression.

  2. **Crontab Expression Validation**
