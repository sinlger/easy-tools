### IT Tools - Case converter User Manual

#### 1. Overview

Case converter is a useful online tool designed to help developers quickly convert strings between different case formats to meet the requirements of various scenarios.

#### 2. Functional Explanation

  1. **Basic Conversion**
     * **Lowercase**：Converts all characters of the input string to lowercase. For example, “Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet” will be converted to “lorem ipsum dolor sit amet”.
     * **Uppercase**：Converts all characters of the input string to uppercase. “lorem ipsum dolor sit amet” will become “LOREM IPSUM DOLOR SIT AMET”.

  2. **Programming - related Conversion**
     * **Camelcase**：Converts the string to camelCase style, where each word except the first one starts with a capital letter and there are no spaces between words. It is often used for variable naming in programming languages. For instance, “lorem ipsum dolor sit amet” will be transformed into “loremIpsumDolorSitAmet”.
     * **Pascalcase**：Similar to camelCase, but the first word also starts with a capital letter. It is commonly used for class naming in programming, such as “LoremIpsumDolorSitAmet”.
     * **Snakecase**：All words are in lowercase and connected by underscores. It is frequently used in configuration files and environment variables. For example, “lorem ipsum dolor sit amet” will be converted to “lorem_ipsum_dolor_sit_amet”.
     * **Constantcase**：All words are in uppercase and connected by underscores. It is typically used to define constants, like “LOREM_IPSUM_DOLOR_SIT_AMET”.

  3. **Specific Scenario and Style Conversion**
     * **Capitalcase**：Capitalizes the first letter of each word while keeping the rest of the letters in lowercase. It is often used for titles or the beginning of sentences, such as “Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet”.
     * **Dotcase**：All words are in lowercase and separated by dots. It can be used for certain specific - format configurations or identifiers, for example, “lorem.ipsum.dolor.sit.amet”.
     * **Headercase**：The first letter of each word is capitalized and words are connected by hyphens. It is commonly used in URL paths or HTTP request headers, like “Lorem-Ipsum-Dolor-Sit-Amet”.
     * **Nocase**：Keeps the original case format of the input string without any conversion.
     * **Paramcase**：All words are in lowercase and connected by hyphens. It is commonly seen in URL parameters or specific - format identifiers, such as “lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet”.
     * **Pathcase**：All words are in lowercase and separated by slashes. It is often used to construct file paths or URL paths, for example, “lorem/ipsum/dolor/sit/amet”.
     * **Sentencecase**：Capitalizes the first letter of the first word of a sentence and keeps the rest of the words in lowercase (unless they need to be capitalized). It is usually used at the beginning of a sentence, such as “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet”.
     * **Mockingcase**：This format randomly changes the case of letters to create an effect as if someone is mocking, for example, “LoReM iPsum DoLor SiT AmEt”.

#### 3. How to Use

  1. **Input String**：Enter the string you want to convert in the “Your string” textbox.
  2. **View Result**：The tool will automatically display the converted result in the corresponding textbox based on the selected format. If you want to copy a conversion result, click the copy button (a button with a document icon and an arrow) on the right side of the result textbox.

#### 4. Applicable Scenarios

This tool is suitable for developers in various scenarios, such as programming, writing documents, constructing URLs, and configuring environment variables. It can quickly convert strings into the required case format, improving work efficiency and ensuring the correctness and uniformity of the format.

In summary, Case converter is a practical and convenient online tool that can meet the needs of string case conversion in different scenarios and help developers efficiently handle string format issues.
