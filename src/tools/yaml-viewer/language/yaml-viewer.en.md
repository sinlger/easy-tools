# Online YAML Prettify and Format Tool User Guide

## Introduction

This online tool is designed to prettify and format YAML strings into a human-friendly, readable format. It helps developers view and edit YAML files more clearly, enhancing code readability and maintainability, especially when dealing with complex or lengthy YAML configurations.

## Features

  * **YAML Prettify and Format** : Paste your raw YAML string into the left text box. The tool will automatically prettify and format it, displaying the result in the right text box. For example, a YAML string that was previously compact, lacked clear indentation, or had a messy format will be neatly reorganized according to standard formatting rules. This allows you to easily see the structure of different levels and key-value pairs, making it simple to locate specific content.

  * **Key Sorting** : The "Sort keys" toggle switch is provided. If you enable this feature, the tool will sort the YAML content alphabetically by key when prettifying and formatting. This is helpful when you need to view or standardize YAML key order. However, note that in some cases, the original order of keys in a YAML file may be significant. Use this feature cautiously to avoid impacting business logic.

  * **Indent Size Adjustment** : You can set the indent size for the prettified and formatted YAML using the "Indent size" option. The default is 2 units, but you can adjust it to meet your reading preferences or project requirements using the "-" and "+" buttons. A common indent size is between 2 and 4 units. Proper indentation helps better illustrate the hierarchical relationships in YAML files, making the visual structure clearer and easier to understand and edit.

## Usage

  1. Open the tool page and paste the raw YAML content you want to prettify and format into the left text box.
  2. Depending on your needs, decide whether to enable the "Sort keys" function. If you want to sort keys, turn on the switch; otherwise, keep it off.
  3. Adjust the indent size using the "-" and "+" buttons in the "Indent size" option.
  4. After completing these settings, the tool will automatically generate the prettified and formatted YAML in the right text box. You can view, copy, and apply the result to your development or configuration work.

## Notes

  1. Ensure the YAML string you're processing has correct syntax. Otherwise, the tool may not work as expected or produce errors. If you're unsure about the YAML syntax, validate it with a YAML syntax checker before using this tool.
  2. Be cautious when handling YAML files containing sensitive or confidential information. Avoid pasting such content into online tools to prevent information leaks. For such files, consider using local software or plugins for YAML prettifying and formatting.
  3. The tool's output is for reference only. Always check and adjust the prettified and formatted YAML according to your project requirements and business context to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.

I hope this user guide helps you better understand and use the online YAML Prettify and Format tool, making it more useful in your development process.
