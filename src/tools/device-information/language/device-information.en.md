# Online Device Information: Function Introduction

## Overview

This online device information tool collects detailed data on your current device, covering screen specs, device type and more. It helps developers understand device attributes for designing better web page layouts and debugging.

## Screen Details

  * **Screen Size**: Shows screen width and height in pixels (e.g., 2560x1392). Vital for designing responsive web layouts to ensure proper content display across different screen dimensions.
  * **Orientation**: Indicates if the screen is in landscape-primary (horizontal) or portrait-primary (vertical) mode. Enables developers to optimize page display for various device orientations.
  * **Orientation Angle**: Displays the screen rotation angle from the vertical direction (e.g., 0Â° for no rotation). Serves as a reference for creating responsive layouts.
  * **Color Depth**: Reveals the number of colors the screen can display (e.g., 24 - bit color). Higher color depth means better image and video quality.
  * **Pixel Ratio**: Reflects the ratio of physical pixels to CSS pixels on the device (e.g., 1dppx for a 1:1 ratio). Key for high - resolution image display and accurate page rendering.
  * **Window Size**: Provides the current browser window dimensions in pixels (e.g., 1865x1316). Essential for adaptive web design based on real - time window size.

## Device Details

  * **Browser Vendor**: Identifies the company that developed the current browser (e.g., Google Inc.). Allows developers to address browser - specific compatibility issues.
  * **Languages**: Lists the languages configured on the device (e.g., zh - CN, en, en - GB, en - US). Helps developers tailor content to different language preferences for multilingual websites.
  * **Platform**: Shows the device's operating system (e.g., Win32). Enables developers to optimize web page performance and functionality for different OS platforms.
  * **User Agent**: Provides the browser's user agent string, including browser name, version and compatibility information. Critical for browser version detection and feature adaptation by developers.
