# IT Tools Online Encryption/Decryption Tool User Guide

## Function Overview

The online encryption/decryption tool provided by IT Tools supports encrypting and decrypting text using various cryptographic algorithms such as AES, TripleDES, Rabbit, and RC4. It enables users to easily encrypt plaintext or decrypt ciphertext to meet daily development and learning needs.

## Encryption

  1. **Plaintext Input** : In the “Encrypt” section, enter the plaintext you want to encrypt in the “Your text” field. For example, input “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet”.
  2. **Set Key** : In the “Your secret key” field, create a key for encryption, such as “my secret key”. The key is essential in the encryption process and must be properly secured.
  3. **Choose Encryption Algorithm** : Select a suitable encryption algorithm from the “Encryption algorithm” dropdown menu, such as AES, TripleDES, Rabbit, or RC4. Different algorithms have distinct security and performance features, so choose based on your actual needs.
  4. **View Encryption Result** : After completing the above steps, the encrypted ciphertext will automatically be displayed in the “Your text encrypted” section, for example, “U2FsdGVkX19wCAAvFjYehC+Haqkp3/xRGF4yN17gt6/FgnlHRvikeCuOvDyAIBvG”.

## Decryption

  1. **Ciphertext Input** : In the “Decrypt” section, enter the ciphertext you want to decrypt in the “Your encrypted text” field, such as “U2FsdGVkX1/EC3+6P5dbbkZ3e1kQ5o2yzuU0NHTjmrKnLBEwreV489Kr0DIB+uBs”.
  2. **Enter Key** : Input the same key used for encryption in the “Your secret key” field, “my secret key”. The correct key is crucial for successful decryption.
  3. **Select Encryption Algorithm** : Choose the same algorithm used for encryption from the “Encryption algorithm” dropdown menu, such as AES.
  4. **View Decryption Result** : The decrypted plaintext will be shown in the “Your decrypted text” section, like “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet”.

## Additional Notes

  * **Security** : Although the tool is convenient, when handling sensitive information, it is advisable to use it in a secure network environment and ensure the security of the key to prevent leakage.
  * **Algorithm Selection** : Different encryption algorithms are suitable for different scenarios. AES is currently one of the widely used and secure algorithms; TripleDES is relatively older but still used in some systems; Rabbit and RC4 also have their own characteristics and application scenarios. Users can choose based on actual needs and security requirements.
