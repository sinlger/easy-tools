# Online Text Comparison Tool User Guide

## I. Tool Introduction

This online text comparison tool is designed to help users quickly identify differences between two text files. With an intuitive interface and clear display of comparison results, it makes it easy for users to view changes in text content, including additions, deletions, and modifications.

## II. Function Description

### (I) Text Input Area

  1. **Original Text Box**: This is where you can input or paste the original text to be compared. You can copy the content from a local text file here or directly edit the text in the box.
  2. **Modified Text Box**: This is where you can input or paste the modified text for comparison with the original. It also supports copy - paste operations and direct text editing.

### (II) Comparison Function

  1. **Text Difference Comparison**: After you input text into both boxes and click the compare button, the tool will scan the two texts line by line to accurately locate the differences, such as changes caused by adding, deleting, or modifying words, and highlight these differences in striking colors for easy viewing.
  2. **Synchronous Scrolling for Comparison**: When dealing with long texts that require scrolling, the two text boxes will scroll in sync. This ensures that you can view corresponding parts of both texts simultaneously, avoiding the inconvenience of comparing texts when one box is scrolled far ahead while the other is still at the beginning, thus improving the efficiency and accuracy of the comparison.

### (III) Result Display

  1. **Difference Highlighting**: Text differences are highlighted with different background or font colors. For instance, content unique to the original text is marked in red, while new content in the modified text is marked in green. This allows you to quickly focus on the changed parts and understand the details of the text modifications.
  2. **Difference Statistics**: In addition to visual highlighting, the tool provides basic statistics on differences, such as the total number of differences and their types (addition, deletion, or modification). This helps you grasp the overall changes in the texts from a macro perspective.

## III. Usage Steps

  1. Open the online text comparison tool page (note: the link provided earlier is for a temperature converter tool; please replace it with the actual text comparison tool link).
  2. Input or paste the original text into the left original text box.
  3. Input or paste the modified text into the right modified text box.
  4. Click the compare button and wait for the tool to complete the text comparison.
  5. View the comparison results by carefully checking the highlighted differences in the text boxes and referring to the difference statistics to fully understand the differences between the texts.

## IV. Notes

  1. Text Format: This tool mainly compares plain text content. For text files with complex formatting (such as specific layout or font styles), it may not perfectly display formatting differences, focusing instead on comparing the text character content itself.
  2. Text Length Limitation: Although the tool can handle texts of a certain length, very long texts may slow down the comparison process or cause performance issues. It is recommended that users reasonably control the length of the input text based on the actual situation, such as breaking extremely long texts into multiple parts for separate comparison.
  3. Data Security: As this is an online tool, the text input will be transmitted over the network. For comparing texts containing sensitive information, be aware of data security risks and use the tool with caution.
