# IPv4 Subnet Calculator User Documentation

The IPv4 Subnet Calculator is a convenient online tool for parsing IPv4 CIDR blocks and retrieving detailed subnet information. Here's an introduction to its features and how to use them:

## Input Function

Enter an IPv4 address with or without a subnet mask in the input box. For example, inputting "192.168.0.1/24" will trigger subnet calculations based on this input.

## Calculation Results Function

  1. **Netmask**
     * Displays the IPv4 address and subnet mask combination, such as "192.168.0.0/24", providing a clear identifier for the network range.

  2. **Network address**
     * Shows the network address, a special address like "192.168.0.0" representing the start of the subnet.

  3. **Network mask**
     * Presents the subnet mask in decimal form, e.g., "255.255.255.0", determining the boundary between the network and host portions of an IP address.

  4. **Network mask in binary**
     * Displays the subnet mask in binary, such as "11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000", aiding in understanding its working principle.

  5. **CIDR notation**
     * Shows the CIDR representation, like "/24", a concise way to indicate the subnet mask length.

  6. **Wildcard mask**
     * Provides the wildcard mask value, for example, "0.0.0.255", often used in network device and software configuration.

  7. **Network size**
     * Indicates the number of IP addresses in the subnet, such as "256", showing the subnet scale.

  8. **First address**
     * Displays the first assignable IP address in the subnet, e.g., "192.168.0.1", the start of host addresses.

  9. **Last address**
     * Shows the last assignable IP address in the subnet, like "192.168.0.254", marking the end of host addresses.

  10. **Broadcast address**
     * Provides the subnet broadcast address, such as "192.168.0.255", used for sending broadcast messages to all hosts in the subnet.

  11. **IP class**
     * Shows the IP address class, like "C", helping understand IP address classification.

## Navigation Function

Offers "Previous block" and "Next block" buttons for quick switching and viewing between adjacent subnet blocks.

With this IPv4 Subnet Calculator, users can easily obtain IPv4 subnet information for network planning, configuration, and management.
