# Token Generator User Guide

## Overview

This Token Generator is a handy online tool that creates random strings based on your chosen characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. It’s useful for developers when generating keys, tokens, etc.

## Features

### Character Type Selection

  * **Uppercase (ABC...)** : When this option is enabled, the generated Token will include uppercase English letters such as A, B, C, etc., enriching the character variety and boosting the complexity of the string.
  * **Lowercase (abc...)** : When selected, lowercase English letters like a, b, c, etc., will be included in the Token generation, increasing the diversity of the string.
  * **Numbers (123...)** : When this option is checked, numerical characters from 0 to 9 will be part of the Token generation, adding more variation to the string.
  * **Symbols (!-...)** : When this feature is activated, common symbols (e.g.,!@#$%^&*) will be included in the Token, further enhancing the complexity and security of the string.

### Length Setting

By sliding the length adjustment bar, you can set the length of the generated Token, usually within a certain numerical range (such as 1 to 128 characters). The longer the length, the more combinations of the generated Token there will be, which generally increases security, but the actual usage scenario’s length requirements should also be considered.

### Token Generation and Operations

  * **Generate Token** : After setting the character type and length, click the relevant button (such as “Generate”), and the system will immediately generate a random Token string based on the configuration, which will be displayed in the designated area.
  * **Copy Token** : After generating the Token, if you need to use it elsewhere, click the “Copy” button to copy the Token string to the clipboard. This allows for quick and easy pasting into the target location without manual recording.
  * **Refresh Token** : If you are not satisfied with the currently generated Token or want to get a new one, click the “Refresh” button. The system will regenerate a Token string based on the current settings, quickly replacing the existing content.
