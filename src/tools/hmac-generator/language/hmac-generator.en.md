# IT Tools Online Hmac Generator User Guide

## I. Tool Introduction

IT Tools' online Hmac generator can compute Hash - based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) using a secret key and selected hashing function. It's ideal for developers to swiftly generate HMAC for authentication in various scenarios.

## II. Feature Description

### Input Section

  1. **plain text** : Enter the plaintext that needs to be hashed.
  2. **secret key** : Input the secret key for HMAC generation.
  3. **hashing function** : Choose the hashing function, with SHA256 as the default. Other options are available.
  4. **output encoding** : Select the output encoding format, defaulting to Hexadecimal (base 16), with other encoding options.

### Output Section

  1. **HMAC of your text** : Displays the generated HMAC value with a copy button.

## III. Operating Steps

**Step 1: Enter plaintext and secret key**

Input the plaintext to be hashed into the "plain text" box and the secret key into the "secret key" box. These are essential for HMAC generation.

**Step 2: Choose hashing function**

Select the desired hashing function from the "hashing function" dropdown menu, such as SHA256 or SHA1. Different functions produce different HMAC results.

**Step 3: Select output encoding**

Pick the preferred output encoding format from the "output encoding" dropdown menu, like Hexadecimal (base 16) or base64. This determines how the HMAC value is presented.

**Step 4: Generate and view HMAC**

After completing the inputs and selections, the system will automatically compute and display the HMAC value in the "HMAC of your text" section.

**Step 5: Copy HMAC**

To use the HMAC value, click the copy button next to the result to copy it to the clipboard for easy pasting elsewhere.
