# IT Tools QR Code Generator User Guide

## I. Introduction

The IT Tools QR Code Generator is a user - friendly online tool. It allows you to quickly create and download QR codes for URLs or plain text with customizable colors.

## II. Features

### (1) Text Input

Enter the content you want to generate a QR code for into the "Text" box. It can be a URL (like <https://it-tools.tech> in the example) or plain text. Once entered, the system will instantly generate a QR code based on your settings.

### (2) Color Settings

  1. **Foreground Color**: Customize the color of the QR code pattern in the "Foreground color" box. The default is black (#000000ff), and you can input other hex color codes.
  2. **Background Color**: Set the background color of the QR code via the "Background color" box. The default is white (#ffffffff), and it also supports hex color code input for personalization.

### (3) Error Resistance Level Selection

Use the "Error resistance" drop - down menu to choose the QR code's error - correction level. In the example, "medium" is selected. Different levels affect the QR code's ability to be recognized correctly when damaged. Higher levels mean more complex patterns but better damage tolerance.

### (4) QR Code Generation and Download

After setting the parameters, the system automatically generates the QR code on the page. If satisfied, click "Download qr-code" to save it locally.

## III. Notes

  1. Avoid overly long input text or URLs to prevent overly complex QR codes that are hard to recognize.
  2. Ensure sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors for accurate scanning.
  3. Select an error - correction level based on the QR code's usage scenario and importance.
