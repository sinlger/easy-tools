# Online Math Calculator User Guide

## I. Tool Overview
The Online Math Calculator is a convenient web-based tool that supports the calculation of various mathematical functions and is suitable for quickly computing mathematical expressions.

## II. Functional Description

### (I) Basic Calculation Function
Users can directly input simple arithmetic expressions into the input box for calculation, such as 2+3, 5-2, 3*4, 6/2, etc., and the system will immediately compute and display the results.

### (II) Function Calculation Function
The calculator supports the following commonly used mathematical functions:
- **sqrt**: Calculates the square root, e.g., sqrt(9).
- **cos**: Calculates the cosine value, e.g., cos(0).
- **sin**: Calculates the sine value, e.g., sin(π/2).
- **abs**: Calculates the absolute value, e.g., abs(-5).

Users can combine numbers and these functions to construct more complex expressions for calculation, such as 2*sqrt(6), cos(π/3)+sin(π/6), etc.

## III. Usage Method
- Open the [Online Math Calculator](https://it-tools.tech/math-evaluator) webpage.
- Input the mathematical expression you want to calculate in the input box.
- After completing the input, the calculator will automatically compute and display the result.
