# Online Password Strength Analyser User Manual
## I. Tool Overview
The Online Password Strength Analyser is a tool designed to evaluate password strength. It assesses factors like password length and complexity to estimate the time needed to crack the password through brute force, helping users gauge its security.
## II. Main Features and Usage
### (I) Password Input and Analysis
- Enter your password into the designated input box. The analyser will automatically assess it and display results upon entry.
- If you need to clear the entered password, click the clear button on the right side of the input box.
### (II) Result Display
- **Time to Crack with Brute Force**: Shows the estimated time a brute - force attack would take to crack the password. Longer times indicate higher password strength. For instance, a weak password might show "Instantly", while a strong one could display "centuries".
- **Password Length**: Displays the number of characters in the password. Generally, longer passwords are more secure.
- **Entropy**: Measures password complexity. Higher entropy means greater uncertainty, making the password harder to crack.
- **Character Set Size**: Indicates the types of characters used. A larger set (e.g., including uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols) enhances password strength.
- **Strength Score**: Rates password strength on a scale of 0 - 100. Higher scores mean better security.
## III. Usage Example
Take the password "P@ssw0rd123" as an example. After input, the analyser may show:
- Brute - force crack time: Years or longer, suggesting it can withstand such attacks to some extent.
- Password length: 12 characters, indicating a moderate length.
- Entropy: A relatively high value like around 75, showing high complexity.
- Character set size: Includes various types like uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
- Strength score: Around 80, implying good password strength.
## IV. Notes
The analyser calculates strength based on brute - force crack time and doesn't consider dictionary attacks. So, even with a high score, avoid using easily - guessable words or personal info as passwords.
