# SVG Placeholder Generator User Guide

## I. Tool Overview

The SVG Placeholder Generator is a handy online utility designed to swiftly create customizable SVG placeholder images. These placeholders are particularly useful in the application development process as temporary image representations, enabling developers to work on interface layouts and design previews even when actual image content is unavailable.

## II. Feature Introduction

  1. **Size Settings**

     * **Width and Height** : You can separately set the width and height (in pixels) of the placeholder image via input boxes, with "+" and "-" buttons provided for quick size adjustment.
     * **Use Exact Size** : Enabling this option ensures that the generated SVG placeholder is displayed strictly according to the specified width and height.

  2. **Color Customization**

     * **Background Color** : Input a hexadecimal color code (e.g., “#cccccc”) to customize the background color of the placeholder.
     * **Text Color** : Similarly, input a hexadecimal color code (e.g., “#333333”) to set the color of the text displayed on the placeholder.

  3. **Text Settings**

     * **Font Size** : Enter a value and select an appropriate unit (such as pixels) to adjust the font size of the text displayed on the placeholder.
     * **Custom Text** : Enter the desired content in the text box. By default, it displays as “width x height” (e.g., “600x350”).

  4. **Preview and Output**

     * **Real - time Preview** : In the preview area on the right, you can instantly view the generated SVG placeholder image based on the set parameters.
     * **SVG HTML Element** : The generated SVG code is displayed, which can be directly copied and used in web development.
     * **SVG in Base64** : The SVG image is provided in Base64 - encoded format, which is convenient for use in scenarios where special encoding is required.

## III. Operating Procedure

  1. Open the [SVG Placeholder Generator website](https://it-tools.tech/svg-placeholder-generator)
  2. Set the width and height of the placeholder according to your requirements. For example, to generate a placeholder with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 450 pixels, enter “800” in the “Width (in px)” input box and “450” in the “Height (in px)” input box.
  3. Customize the background and text colors. If you want a light blue background (e.g., “#e6f7ff”) and dark blue text (e.g., “#1890ff”), input the corresponding color codes in the respective input boxes.
  4. Set the font size and custom text. Assuming a font size of 20 pixels and the desired displayed text is “Sample”, enter “20” in the “Font size” input box and “Sample” in the “Custom text” input box.
  5. Check the preview area on the right to confirm that the generated placeholder image meets your expectations.
  6. Depending on your actual usage requirements, copy the code provided in the “SVG HTML element” section, or copy the Base64 - encoded string in the “SVG in Base64” section. You can also click the “Download svg” button to directly download the generated SVG file.

## IV. Examples

  1. **Example 1: Basic Placeholder Generation**

     * Set the width to 300 pixels, the height to 200 pixels, the background color to “#f5f5f5”, the text color to “#666666”, the font size to 16 pixels, and keep the default text display of “300x200”. Generate a simple basic placeholder to reserve space in a web page layout.

  2. **Example 2: Custom Text Placeholder**

     * Set the width to 500 pixels, the height to 300 pixels, the background color to “#ffd700”, the text color to “#8b4513”, the font size to 24 pixels, and input “Under Construction” in the “Custom text” input box. Generate a placeholder to indicate that a page or feature is under construction, alerting users that the relevant content is not yet complete.

  3. **Example 3: Special - sized and Colored Placeholder**

     * Set the width to 1200 pixels, the height to 630 pixels, enable the “Use exact size” option, set the background color to “#ff6b6b”, the text color to “#ffffff”, the font size to 32 pixels, and input “Featured Image Placeholder” as the text content. Generate a placeholder suitable for social media platforms and other scenarios requiring specific sizes and eye - catching colors, to mark the position of featured images.

## V. Notes

  1. Ensure that the input color codes are correctly formatted to avoid abnormal color display.
  2. When using Base64 - encoded SVGs, be aware that they may impact file size and loading performance. Choose to use them appropriately based on the scenario.
